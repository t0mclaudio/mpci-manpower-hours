# Labor Cost Calculator Online Tool
by Tom Claudio

Live App: [Man Power Hours Calculator](https://mpci-manhours.netlify.com/)

## Overview
MPCI is a labor intensive production company that uses a third party system for time keeping of job activities for a project. There is no feature in the system to filter job items and compute total number of hours incurred for each project. A raw tabular data is provided by the vendor and processed manually by a staff member for reporting. The manual process usually takes 30 minutes to complete.

## What is the problem I was trying to solve here?
To reduce the time to prepare the report.

## What is the result when you use the online tool?
I run the tool feeding it with a tabular data consisting of 5000 job items. What used to take more than 30 minutes to process, took less than 5 seconds using the tool.

## Extra information
This is just a proof of concept as presented in the board meeting.
